###### solaria is language of composobility

For a single user, solarea is a solid tool to 
* model approaches, design strategies 
* create reusable solutions that solve ```your case, as just a 
use case```
* classify and trade these solutions

Theres a higher scope, where people can form organizational structures. 
* Solarea provides a way to develop interconnected economies, each in its specific domain, but closely 
linked to other economic domains. 
* Solarea allows creation of DAOs in an easy intuitive way. DAOs can span economic domains, creating an organizational structure 
linking economic domains, e.g. a DAO can include people in all walks of life, giving it vision, vitality and robustness. 
* In practice, solarea can run entire country, as just a use case of a community, organizing and guiding citezens into the structure of 
  freedom, away from rigid corporate hierarchy.  
    
Yet, theres even higher scope. Solarea itself is run as a DAO, with the high goal of supporting budding communities worldwide
* Any user can become part of Solaria DAO 
* Solaria DAO members will stake funds into a treasury fund, and distribution from that fund will be decided thru an open democratic process.
* As we develop our alternative economies on the cloud, its not enough for selfsufficiency. We simply need land to produce goods and services 
to trade over blockchain. I see the rest of activity online as simply overhead to that. Without our own oasisys of alternative culture, we will be spinning 
  our wheels till we run out of steam to maintain the bubble. 
  
* I propose to dedicate Solarea DAO to the high moral goal of supporting deserving communities with land grants out of the treasury fund.
The grant recipients will be determined thru an open process by all the members. I see it as a taxation system. Perhaps,  it should be a voluntary taxation, with an opt out. 
  But, the advantage of that tax is the freedom to travel globally, to communities you helped to nurture, as an honored guest. We can add all kinds of 
  nice travel perks for VIP travellers.
