##### This is a proposal on how to unite solarea and logicEngine.

###### Solarea core
This is the npm package served from a cdn, to any UIX hardware node.

###### UIX node
A server running solarea core, providing services to solarea users

###### Services available thru a UIX node
* Access to user account
  
with users instances of logicEngine and instances of particles populating them. These are the 
treenity tree structures, previously created, and accessible to user.
  
* Logic editor

A graphical editor, an **IDE like environment**, where a user can create custom logicEngines and compose models
of structures, new particles, by composing from other logic engines instances, available in solarea public space.

**From the logic editor, user is able to instantiate any of his models**, to create a live treenity tree, and save it 
to his account on blockchain

**The editor will allow to convert scripts of its making, into hardcoded modules**, that extend solarea core with
additional functionalities, available to other users once that codebase is used to build new UIX node. So, this will allow 
customization of each UIX node, to provide diversity within the ecosystem, and creating specialized domains.

**Advantage of hardcoded logic elements living on UIX nodes**, rather then as scripts on blockchain, is no storage fees.
Basically, its a way to extend core functionality with new buildin elements, bypassing the blockchain ecosystem.
Why its a good idea, i dont know, but logicEngine does provide that capability. One of the reasons is its a bit scary
to  have all codebase living on blockchain in serialized form, but its possible.

###### Solarea ecosystem
This is **solarea account on blockchain**, where users can publish logicEngine instances of their making, to be available
within solarea marketplace. 

Each logicEngine instance is a consistent logic system. Each can import other logicEngine instances, and access
imported elements for its own compositions. When a logicEngine instance is published, all its particles, laws and
gauges become available to anyone importing that logicEngine system, for composing its own logic entities.

###### Solarea ecosystem explorer
A graphical query and a playground environment where a user can find logicEngines in the domain of their interest.
using intellegent search algorithms, similar to google search. Each hit can be interacted with within the solarea
playground, to learn about it and its functionalities. Perhaps, even interact with the community, other using it.
